The implementation is taken from Chibi Scheme, updated to remove
dependencies on (chibi show), (chibi string) and (chibi monad environment).

Some files are reorganized a bit, non-public sld are all in (srfi 159
internal). show.scm is renamed util.scm. The environment monad is
simply expanded [1] in monad.scm

Note, some code may still rely on srfi-13 predicate behavior even
though srfi-130 is imported. If a scheme is very strict about this,
you may see some errors.

(chibi test) library is also embedded to run test.scm, but (srfi 64)
should probably work fine (Larceny uses this because there's some
problem with running (chibi test) on it).

Tested on Gauche, Chibi, Larceny, Gerbil [2], Sagittarius.

[1] no point to have a single-use monad macro, just harder to
    understand. But also the macro triggered some bug in Gauche where
    all this work started.

[2] Not fully passed. Some numeric formatting problems.
