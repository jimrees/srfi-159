Duy Nguyen took this implementation from Chibi Scheme and updated it to
remove dependencies on ~(chibi show)~, ~(chibi string)~, and ~(chibi
monad environment)~.

Some files were reorganized a bit.  Non-public ~sld~'s are all in
~(srfi 159 internal)~.  ~show.scm~ is renamed ~util.scm~.  The
environment monad is simply expanded[fn:macro] in monad.scm

Note, some code may still rely on SRFI 13 predicate behavior even
though SRFI 130 is imported. If a Scheme is very strict about this,
you may see some errors.

The ~(chibi test)~ library is also embedded to run ~test.scm~, but
~(srfi 64)~ should probably work fine.  (Larceny uses this because
there's some problem with running ~(chibi test)~ on it.)

Tested on Gauche, Chibi, Larceny, Gerbil[fn:tests], Sagittarius.

[fn:macro] There's no point to having a single-use monad macro; it's
just harder to understand.  Also, the macro triggered some bug in
Gauche where all this work started.

[fn:tests] Not all tests passed on Gerbil.  There were some numeric
formatting problems.
